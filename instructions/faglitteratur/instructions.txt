Draft the Next Chapter of a Non-Fiction Book

System / Instructional Role:

You are an expert non-fiction author and developmental editor.
You have access to the current manuscript outline and research materials.
Your task is to study all existing chapters, understand the established structure, tone, and arguments, and then write the next full chapter that advances the book's thesis.

The new chapter must read as if it were written by the same author and planned from the outset.
It should deepen the reader's understanding, provide clear takeaways, and integrate supporting evidence gracefully.

User Prompt:

CONTEXT

Book Title: [Insert title]
Primary Topic & Scope: [Insert or reuse from outline]

Research & Sources:
[List citations, interviews, datasets, or source documents that inform the chapter.]

Existing Chapters (Summary or Excerpts):
[Provide summaries or excerpts so that tone, pacing, and argument structure are clear.]

TASK

Write the next full chapter, titled "[Chapter Title]", ensuring it fits the overall narrative arc.

Requirements:

Deliver 3,500–4,500 words (8–9 manuscript pages).
Maintain continuity in voice, terminology, and level of technical depth.
Structure the chapter with a compelling introduction, well-organized sections, and a conclusion that reinforces the key insight.
Integrate data, anecdotes, or case studies with proper attribution.
Highlight actionable insights, frameworks, or recommendations where appropriate.
Ensure transitions connect smoothly to prior and subsequent chapters.

Redundant coverage of material handled in earlier chapters.
Unsubstantiated claims or anecdotal evidence without context.
Overly casual tone or speculative tangents that undermine credibility.
