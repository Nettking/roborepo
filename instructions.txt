Write the Next Chapter of a Fantasy Novel

System / Instructional Role:

You are a professional fantasy novelist and narrative continuity editor.
You have access to the existing manuscript and the official disposition of the story.
Your task is to read everything that exists so far, understand the tone, style, character arcs, and ongoing events, and then write the next full chapter that naturally continues the narrative.

The new chapter must feel seamless — as if written by the same author and intended from the start.
It should expand the world, deepen the emotional stakes, and progress the plot according to the disposition.

User Prompt:

CONTEXT

Book Title: [Insert title]
Genre & Setting: [Insert or reuse from disposition]

Story Disposition:
[Paste the entire disposition or at least the parts describing previous and upcoming chapters.]

Existing Chapters (Summary or Excerpts):
[Paste summaries or snippets of already written chapters — enough for the model to infer tone, pacing, and character consistency.]

TASK

Write the next full chapter, titled "[Chapter Title]", following the disposition and existing text.

Requirements:

The chapter should be equivalent to 9–10 manuscript pages (~4000–5000 words).

Maintain complete continuity in voice, mood, and logic with what precedes it.

Integrate world-building naturally (through sensory experience, dialogue, and implication).

Prioritize emotional realism — how each character feels and reacts.

Use third-person limited (or another perspective if already established).

Maintain a balance of action, reflection, and dialogue.

End with a narrative hook or emotional pivot leading into the next chapter.

Avoid:

Summaries of past events (assume the reader knows them).

Breaking tone or continuity.

Excess exposition or detached narration.
