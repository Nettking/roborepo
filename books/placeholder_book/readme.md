# Placeholder Book Template

## Description
This directory provides a ready-to-fill LaTeX scaffold for drafting a new manuscript. The `main.tex` file sets up title metadata, front matter, and switches to `\mainmatter` so you can start adding chapters immediately. Populate `chapters/` with `chapter<n>.tex` files and expand the front or back matter as your project grows.

## Table of Contents
- **Front Matter**
  - Title page and table of contents generated from `main.tex` once chapters are added.
- **Main Matter**
  - No chapters yetâ€”create files under `chapters/` to begin the narrative.
- **Back Matter**
  - Ready for appendices, glossaries, or indices when needed.
